{"name":"Ubuntu CDE","tagline":"An Ubuntu Remix with the Common Desktop Enviroment installed.","body":"Created by [Joey Schaff](https://www.twitter.com/Jaoheah), with huge help from [Kai](https://www.twitter.com/KaiLikesLinux) the lead developer of [Ubuntu Lumina](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Lumina) and [Joshua](https://www.twitter.com/ItzSwirlz) the lead developer of [Ubuntu Cinnamon](https://github.com/Ubuntu-Cinnamon-Remix) \r\n\r\nUbuntu CDE is currently under development. This is my first ever attempt at making a Remix of Ubuntu, so it may take a while for the first ISO to come out.\r\n\r\nMake sure to thank [these](https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/_members/) wonderful people for continuing this 25 year old Desktop Environment. With out them, Ubuntu CDE would have never happened.","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
